A 2D snooker game written in ActionScript 3. Can be played by a single player (against the CPU) or by two players.

## How to run the game
The game has been written for the Adobe Flash platform. While Flash is no longer supported in web browsers, alternatives are available:
* Use a standalone Flash Player, if you have one already installed.
* Port the game to Adobe AIR or [OpenFL](https://www.openfl.org/).
* Use the [Ruffle](https://ruffle.rs/) Flash Player emulator (however, its support for AS3 as of now is not sufficient for the game to be able to run).

## How to play
Follow the instructions that appear on screen.
